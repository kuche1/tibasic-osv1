After the terrain generator creates the terrain, you will be at the main game screen.

the angle, and the current health of your tank. 
You can change the angle by pressing the up and down keys. Press 2nd to
confirm.

After pressing 2nd, the white bar will say the wind speed, the power and the current weapon.

of the weapon you have currently. Press 2nd to confirm.

After one tank has died, you will be brought to the store. You can buy extra weapons here 
if you have money. The number at the bottom of the screen tells you how much money you have.
The "x" after the weapons tells you the amount of that weapon that you have now.
The "-" after the weapon tells you the price of the weapon.

--How do I earn money?
If you destroy the other tank, you get $1500. If you bring the health of the other tank to 4 or below,
you get $500.


Known issues:
If your weapon touches the ground close to the sides of the screen, the weapon
will go through the ground. This is meant to avoid [ERR: INVALID DIM] errors.

Sometimes the weapon leaves a white hole in the ground. This does not affect gameplay.

In the store, sometimes a piece of the previous amount of money is displayed. This does not affect your money or the store's functions.
